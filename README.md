### Project Code

#### `pom.xml`
The Maven `pom.xml` file to manage dependencies and project configuration.

### Source Code

#### `App.java`
This is the main class where we simulate the application with a basic command-line interface.

#### `Flight.java`
Represents a flight with seats and handles multithreading with `ReentrantLock`.

#### `Passenger.java`
Represents a passenger with a name and passport number.

#### `Seat.java`
Represents a seat on a flight.

#### `BookingService.java`
Handles the booking of seats for passengers.

#### `CheckInService.java`
Handles the check-in process for passengers.


#### `FlightService.java`
Handles the creation of flights with a fixed number of seats.

### Running the Project

1. **Compile and package the application**:

2. **Run the application**:

### Usage

- After starting the application, select options to book a flight or check-in using the command line.
- This multithreaded setup allows simultaneous booking requests with thread-safe access to seat assignments.
